## Crime & Housing In The Bronx
![](https://github.com/EdwinVelazquez/Crime-Housing/blob/master/crime%20pic1.jpg)

#### This project  performs an analysis on a handful of neighborhoods for purchase of a single family home in The Bronx.

#### The major concerns were felony crime and investment value.

#### Is there really a correlation between the two?

#### Is there a correlation between Police Precinct Locations & crime?

#### Below is a screen shot of the interactive folium map that I will be using in my presentation

#### The chart on the left shows the magnitude of crime in the particular neighborhoods requested.

#### The chart on the right is for making a comparative analysis of crime and costs in those areas.

#### With the folium map, it is quite clear (and surprising) to see that proximity to police precincts doesnâ€™t have the presumed positive effect on crime in the area.
